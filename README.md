# App-Development
Apps to Learn and Demonstrate Building Skills

---

Start with drawing program and music program Case Studies,
- then finish drawing program,
- then complete music program,
- then add music and sound effects to drawing program

Reminder: prototype music buttons in keyPressed(). Students responsible for mousePressed().

Remember: using my lessons on Music Player Buttons (my IF Algorithms) can achieve a very good grade, but not a full grade on the music player.
- You will need to change the music player button algorithms so play, pause, stop, next, and previous function a little different
- You will need to describe how your player works differently than my player if you want these marks (to point this out to me)
- Note: additional buttons and data that will elevate your music player into Final Special Project status
  - At least five pieces of data from song file meta data (see Single Song Functions & Multiple Songs with Arrays)
  - UNDERCONSTRUCTION: Volume Buttons and Volume "Number" Display, including Mute Button (see Single Song Functions)
  - UNDERCONSTRUCTION: Randomize Play List Button (see Multiple Songs with Arrays)
  - Button: Set Loop Points (see Single Song Functions)
  - Displaying Wave Form Progressions (see Single Song Functions)
  - Equalizer Buttons: Balance, Control, Programming
    - See http://code.compartmental.net/minim/audioplayer_class_audioplayer.html

Reminder: example code for Music Player and any final project is found in
- File / Examples
Continue with Final Special Project, to be discussed with Mr. Mercer
- Promotion Website as Example Project
- Android Sideloading as Example Project
- Extending Music Program beyond lessons (or another programming project)
- Private Messaging Program (visual data and/or text): see Mr. Mercer
  - Only group project (due to server-client model)
  - Also see https://processing.org/tutorials/network/
  - See, for example working programs: https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Network-Sandbox/tree/main/From%20Website/SharedDrawingCanvas
- [Depreciated, unsupported] Applet Maker and Signer (using a processing tool), see https://processing.org/reference/tools/ for instructions, discussions and other information

Progression (**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**)
- Complete Case Studies for Drawing and Music Programs
  - Review Student Exemplars in Computer App Examples (https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Computer-App-Exemplars)
  - Review Example of Pseudocode
- Complete Pseudo code and Rectangle GUI Layout (for inscribed 2D Shapes, Text, Images, and Interactive Buttons)
- Review how to create drawing tools with virtual paper "button" (lines and circles)
- *Work on Drawing Program everyday*
- Explore YouTube Audio Library (free music and sound effects), https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCkhFasU2ZSgusy_b1l4bcHg/music
  - Review my downloaded exemplar music files (meditative music, other music)
  - Students able to use music they own (have rights to play)
- Learning Minim Library to play music and sounds from within an app
  - installing the library to the IDE
  - adding the library to the program
- Review "Most Minimal Code" example: introduce installing library to IDE and adding library to program using IDE
  - Review how to find coding examples
  - Review http://code.compartmental.net/minim/
- Example using Pseudocode as Prototyping Starter
  - Review using Pseudocode Example, Single Button to Console: debugging with println()
  - Review Single Button Play Pause
- Review Prototyping in keyPressed, Algorithms for
  - Plan all algorithms using available functions (see https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/App-Development/tree/main/Music%20Program/Prototyping%20Minim/ListingMinimFuctions)
  - Play Pause
  - Play Stop
  - Skip in Forward and Reverse
  - Loop Code Examples: Once, Number-as-Variable (see Behaviour of Loop .txt); includes additional "text" lesson
  - Meta Data Lessons: all functions and loading multiple songs (review all functions with single song, then load multiple songs, then change code to illustrate FOR Loop displaying multiple song's meta data
  - Next and Previous Buttons (for multiple songs): Load Multiple Songs
  - Next and Previous Algorithms, including error checking for "Array Out of Bounds"
  - Combinations: Text Song Title: See "DisplayTwoSongTitles.pde"
- Review Exemplar Single Song
- Multiple Songs

- Additional Exemplars, not taught
    - set Loop Points
    - Wave Forms Progressions

- Hint about randomizing a Playlist: use math-random to randomly pick one of the "index-array" song numbers

- Reminder: apply music player knowledge to sound effects (part of final exam)

# To Include

Simple Code for Background Music: https://poanchen.github.io/blog/2016/11/15/how-to-add-background-music-in-processing-3.0

## Teaching Idea

Single Song IF Statements
- IF ElseIf Else: most difficult first (sorry in advance), for play pause
- IF Else: for Stop
- Single-Line-IF: for Fast Forward and Reverse

List all functions
Develop IF Statements as a concept

---

Rewrite all single song functions to include .loop(0) as the play button
- avoids the bug between .loop() and .play(): to loop the song needs to stop and then song will start again

See .txt in Single Song Functions, required for Drawing Program

---

Most minimal code to play a song: Minim Single Song Functions / 01 Most minimal code to play one song
- Review installing a library
- Install the library before global variables

Review Pseudocode and Single Button with Power Button, see Folder: Minim Exemplar Pseudocode and Button
