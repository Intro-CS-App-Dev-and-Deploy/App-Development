Loop is actaully a play button, with parameter of zero
Loop without a parameter is an infinite Loop
Loop with a number is a "play" and then the number of loops
  - i.e. loop(1) plays once and repeats once

Note: the play-pause button still works
- CAUTION: if you press P first, it will play
- If you then press L, it will stop the song and start it again
- This creates a little bit of a bug that can be solved if .loop(0) is actually the play button



Progression Reminders: infinite function, once parameter as variable, setting loop variable example code (prototyped in keyPressed)

.loop(int) automatically loops the song, and re-starts playing from the beginning
- Notice: .loop(int) will play the song first, then loop it for the number of times

How .loop() works in Minim:
- Press l or L press, when nothing is playing: play the current song and loop it once

How .loop() repeats more than once: use a variable (See loopnum.pde exemplar)
Note: includes following functions ...
- .loopCount() //returns number of loops that are available
- .isLooping() //returns True or False
