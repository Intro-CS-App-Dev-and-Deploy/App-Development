Progression Reminders: infinite function, once parameter as variable, setting loop variable example code (protoytyped in keyPressed)

.loop(int) automatically loops the song, and re-starts playing from the beginning
- Notice: .loop(int) will play the song first, then loop it for the number of times

How .loop() works in Minim: 
- Press l or L press, when nothing is playing: play the current song and loop it once 

How .loop() repeats more than once: use a variable (See loopnum.pde exemplar)
Note: includes following functions ...
- .loopCount() //returns number of loops that are available
- .isLooping() //returns True or False
