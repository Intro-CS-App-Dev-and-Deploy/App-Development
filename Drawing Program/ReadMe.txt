Addtional Examples of how mousePressed() can communicate with draw()
- strokeWieght(brushSize); //populate brushsize in mousePressed but use strokeWieght() in draw()
- "colouring book behaviour": load an image into the "button" for drawing as a background to draw overtop of, using image() in mousePressed where the rect() parameters for the background image() is the rect() for drawing
  - this might need to be a procdure passing parameters to reuse the image code
- another?
