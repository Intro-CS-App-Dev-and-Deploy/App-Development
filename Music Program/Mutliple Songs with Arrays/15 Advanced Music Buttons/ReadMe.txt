Workflow & Describe Behaviours (if yours behaves like this, I will know)
- Purpose: change the code so beahviours are different

- Start the Program, starts the music at the first song
- Prototype in separate program, with autoloading, start playing at any loaded song space

- Then ... Develop this with students

See
App-Development\Music Program\Work Flow\Single Song

Example Progression
- STOP
- LOOP: 1 to 9, infinite
.play() includes .rewind()

.loop() should correct error of how many times song will play
- if song starts over again
- .isPlaying() saves .position() and rewrites .play(parameter), skipping it to that part of the song
- if the song stops looping, just play the next song
