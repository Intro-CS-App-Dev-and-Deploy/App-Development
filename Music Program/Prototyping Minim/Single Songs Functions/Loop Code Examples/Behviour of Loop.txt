.loop(int) automatically loops the song, and starts playing from the beginning
- for the number listed
- Notice: .loop(int) will play the song first, then loop it for the number of times

Press l or L when nothing is playing
- Play the current song and loop it

Press l or L when song is playing and looping
- stop the loop, finish the song playing

Note: song is always looping infinitely so when lorL is pressed,
it does not restart the song

Note about isLopping()
- empty parameter means infinite loop
- int as parameter means loop than many times (can be advanced behaviour in player)
